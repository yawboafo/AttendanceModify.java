AttendanceModify.java
=====================

OK I JUST STARTED CODING IN JAVA AGAIN AND I REALISE I SUCK BAD SERIOUSLY ABSTAINING FROM A "CODE"LANGUAGE CAN MAKE YOU LOOSE SKILLS><THEREFORE THIS IS A SIMPLE TERMINAL APP I DREW TO CHECK  CLASS ATTENDANCE AND SAVE IT IN A TEXTFILE NAMED “Attendance.txt”.  FIRST YOU SPECIFY THE CLASS OR COURSE ATTRIBUTES ,THEN ENTER INDEX NUMBERS ,WHEN INDEX NUMBERS ARE SET ,THEN THE GAME BEGINS ,ENTER ONE(1) FOR PRESENT ANYTHING ELSE WILL BE ABSENT.ALSO I AM USING A FILE SYSTEM TO SAVE THE RECORD,THEREFORE A FILE WILL BE CREATED IN YOUR WORKSPACE “%” FOLDER (DON’T OPEN WITH NOTEPAD USE SOMETHING HEAVY SIMPLE BECAUSE NOTEPAD IGNORES THE JAVA FORMATTING  AND  SCATTERS THE DATA  )
